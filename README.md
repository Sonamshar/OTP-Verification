OTP Verification System with Twilio and Tkinter
Overview
This Python script implements an OTP (One Time Password) verification system using Twilio for SMS delivery and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). The system generates a random OTP and sends it via SMS to a specified phone number. Users can enter the OTP in the GUI to verify their identity.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Twilio Account SID and Auth Token
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Installation
Install Python 3.x from the official Python website.
Install the Twilio Python library using pip:
Copy code
pip install twilio
Ensure you have the required image files (submit.png and resendotp.png) for the buttons in the same directory as the script.
Configuration
Before running the script, make sure to:

Replace "ACeacdd556a87f15bb145bd1213acd6860" with your Twilio Account SID.
Replace "c3263c8ef43da3449098c5e3521be8df" with your Twilio Auth Token.
Specify the destination phone number in the to parameter of the client.messages.create() method.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions and credits in your Twilio account for sending SMS.
Usage
Run the script using Python:
Copy code
python otp_verification.py
The GUI window will appear with OTP verification options.
Enter the OTP received via SMS into the provided input field.
Click the "Submit" button to verify the OTP.
If the OTP is correct, a message indicating successful login will be displayed.
Click the "Resend OTP" button to generate and send a new OTP via SMS.
Notes
This OTP verification system is for demonstration purposes and may require additional security measures for production use.
Ensure that the image files (submit.png and resendotp.png) are accessible in the script's directory.
